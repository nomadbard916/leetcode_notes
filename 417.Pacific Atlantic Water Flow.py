        # Key Insight: Reverse the Flow Direction
        # - Normal thinking (inefficient): For each cell, check if water can flow to both oceans.
        # This requires exploring from 417 cells potentially, with many redundant paths.

        # - Clever thinking (efficient): Start from the oceans and flow backward (upward in height).
        # We only do 2 complete searches instead of checking every cell.
        # Any cell visited by both searches can reach both oceans!

        # ! sol1: DFS

        Find cells where water can flow to both Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

        Strategy: Instead of starting from each cell and checking if it reaches
        both oceans, we start from both oceans and find all reachable cells,
        that is going reversely to traverse to higher cell.

        The intersection gives us cells that can reach both oceans.
