# [42] Trapping Rain Water

from typing import List


class Solution:
    #     Why 42 Got "Hard" Label:
    # - Multiple Valid Approaches: Problem 42 has 4+ different solution approaches
    # (two pointers, DP, stack, brute force), which might make it seem more complex
    # - Visualization Difficulty: Some people find it harder to visualize
    # water "trapped above" vs water "contained between"
    # - Historical Context: It might have been one of the earlier problems on LeetCode
    # when the difficulty calibration wasn't as refined
    # - Edge Cases: Problem 42 has slightly more edge cases to handle (empty arrays, arrays with < 3 elements)
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        # ! sol1: two pointers (with two additional state-tracking pointers), also most efficient
        # The key insight is that the amount of water that can be trapped at any position
        # depends on the minimum of the maximum heights to its left and right

        # Step by step:
        # 1. Use two pointers from both ends
        # 2. Keep track of max heights seen so far from each side
        # 3. Always process the side with smaller height
        # 4. If current height < max height on that side, water is trapped
        LEN = len(height)
        if not height or LEN < 3:
            return 0

        l, r = 0, LEN - 1
        max_height_l, max_height_r = 0, 0
        water_trapped = 0

        while l < r:
            curr_height_l = height[l]
            curr_height_r = height[r]

            # - If left_height < right_height, then right side definitely has a higher max
            # - So we can safely process the left side
            # - Vice versa for the right side

            # We're not splitting the problem - we're choosing which side we can safely process
            # based on which side gives us enough information to make a definitive calculation.

            # The algorithm is brilliant because it realizes:
            # We don't need to know the exact maximum on both sides -
            # we just need to know which side is the limiting factor!

            # Think of it like this:
            # If I'm standing between two walls, the water level is determined by the shorter wall
            # If I can see that the right wall is definitely taller than where I'm standing, then I only need to worry about the left wall height
            # I don't need to measure the exact height of the right wall!

            if curr_height_l < curr_height_r:
                # Process left side
                if curr_height_l >= max_height_l:
                    max_height_l = curr_height_l
                else:
                    water_trapped += max_height_l - curr_height_l
                l += 1

            else:
                # Process right side
                if curr_height_r >= max_height_r:
                    max_height_r = curr_height_r
                else:
                    water_trapped += max_height_r - curr_height_r
                r -= 1

        return water_trapped

        # ! sol2: brute force
        # For each position, find max height to left and right,
        # then calculate water that can be trapped.
