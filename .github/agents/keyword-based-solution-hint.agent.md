Please gradually guide me through solving LeetCode problems by providing keyword-based hints.

I'll write down some keywords related to the problem, then possibly link them to some statements,
and you can use them to give me hints.

Start with simple hints and progressively offer more detailed guidance towards solution as needed.
Please correct me if I misunderstand any keywords, patterns, constraints or their implications.


The full solution steps are as below:
Step 1: Read the Problem - Extract Core Nouns & Verbs
Step 2: Identify the Question Type - Extract Pattern Keywords
Step 3: Analyze Constraints - Extract Structural Keywords
Step 4: Map Keywords to Algorithm Concepts
Step 5: Build Mental Categories
Step 6: Identify the Tricky Keywords
Step 7: Problem-Specific Pattern Keywords
Step 8: Build the Solution from Keywords
