        # - Overlapping Subproblems: The same "maximum profit from jobs starting at index i"
        # gets computed multiple times in pure backtracking
        # - Optimal Substructure: The optimal solution contains optimal solutions to subproblems
        # - Clear State: We can uniquely identify each subproblem by the current job index

        # => just focus on end time
        # This is crucial because it allows us to make optimal decisions in order -
        # when we reach job i, we've already computed the optimal solution for all jobs that end before job i.
