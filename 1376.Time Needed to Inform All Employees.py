        # ! sol1: DFS
        # * Build adjacency list representation of the company hierarchy

        subordinates = {}

            if manager_id != -1:
                subordinates[manager_id].append(employee_id)

        def dfs(employee_id: int) -> int:
            # * DFS execution order:
            # ðŸ“ž CALLS go DOWN (depth-first): Keep making recursive calls going deeper
            # ðŸ”™ RETURNS go UP (bottom-up): Values are calculated and returned from leaves upward
            # ðŸ§® CALCULATION happens ON RETURN: When a recursive call returns, we use its result

            # The Mental Model:
            # Think of DFS like exploring a cave system:

            # Going down: You explore each tunnel as deep as possible
            # Hit bottom: You reach a dead end (leaf node)
            # Measure and report back: "This tunnel is X deep"
            # Parent tunnel: Chooses the deepest sub-tunnel, adds its own depth
            # Report up: Continues until you reach the entrance

            # Base case: if this employee has no subordinates (leaf node), no  time needed
            if not subordinates[employee_id]:
                return 0

            # Find the maximum time among all subordinates
            max_subordinate_time = 0
            for subordinate_id in subordinates[employee_id]:
                subordinate_total_time = dfs(subordinate_id)
                max_subordinate_time = max(max_subordinate_time, subordinate_total_time)

            # * post order logic
            # Total time = time for this employee to inform + max time for subordinates
            return informTime[employee_id] + max_subordinate_time

        # Start DFS from the head of company
        return dfs(headID)

        # Time and Space Complexity:
        # Time Complexity: O(n) - We visit each employee exactly once
        # Space Complexity: O(n) - For the adjacency list and recursion stack (in worst case of skewed tree)

        # ! sol2: BFS, but it doesn't have strong advantage
        from collections import deque

        # Build adjacency list
        subordinates = {}
        for manager_id in range(n):
            subordinates[manager_id] = []

        for employee_id in range(n):
            manager_id = manager[employee_id]
            # -1 indicates this is the head (no manager)
            if manager_id != -1:
                subordinates[manager_id].append(employee_id)

        # (employee_id, time_so_far)
        q = deque[(headID, 0)]
        max_time = 0

        while quit:
            current_employee, time_so_far = deque.popleft()

            max_time = max(max_time, time_so_far)

        # When BFS vs DFS Actually Matters:
        # BFS is better when:
        # - You want the shortest path (not applicable here)
        # - You need level-order processing
        # - You want to find any solution quickly (not maximum)
        # - Memory usage of DFS recursion is a concern

        # DFS is better when:
        # - You need all paths or maximum/minimum among paths (our case)
        # - You want simpler recursive code
        # - You're doing tree traversal problems
