# [1008] Construct Binary Search Tree from Preorder Traversal

# @lc code=start
from typing import List, Optional


# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right


class Solution:
    def bstFromPreorder(self, preorder: List[int]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        # sol1: DFS with stack
        # When constructing a BST from a preorder traversal, we need to maintain a structure that helps us find the correct parent for each new node. The key insight is:

        # In a preorder traversal of a BST, we visit nodes in the order: root, left subtree, right subtree.
        # We need to connect each new node to either the left or right child position of an appropriate parent.

        # A stack works well because:
        # Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) property: The most recently visited potential parent node is at the top of the stack, which is essential for the preorder traversal's depth-first nature.
        # Backtracking capability: When we encounter a value larger than nodes on our current path, we can pop nodes until we find a suitable parent.
        if not preorder:
            return None
        # First item in preorder list is the root to be considered.
        root = TreeNode(preorder[0])
        stack = [root]
        # For next item in preorder list, there are 2 cases to consider:
        for value in preorder[1:]:
            node = TreeNode(value)

            # case 1: If current value is less than the top item in stack,
            # it is the left child of top item.
            if value < stack[-1].val:
                stack[-1].left = node
            else:
                parent: Optional[TreeNode] = None
                # case 2: If value is greater than top item in stack,
                # pop nodes until we find the right parent
                # DO NOT FEAR OF stack iteration.
                # it's just a temp DS for finding the correct insertion point, in the end every node will be processed
                while stack and stack[-1].val < value:
                    parent = stack.pop()
                # The last popped item will be the parent and the item will be the right child of the parent.
                parent.right = node

            # Always push the new node onto the stack
            stack.append(node)
        return root
        # Time Complexity: O(n) - Each node is still processed once and pushed/popped at most once.
        # Space Complexity: O(h) - Where h is the height of the tree.

        # sol2: problem decomposition,
        if not preorder:
            return None

        # First element in preorder is the root
        root_val = preorder[0]
        root = TreeNode(root_val)

        # Find the index where values become greater than root_val
        # This is where the right subtree starts
        i = 1
        while i < len(preorder) and preorder[i] < root_val:
            i += 1

        # Recursively build left and right subtrees
        root.left = self.bstFromPreorder(preorder[1:i])
        root.right = self.bstFromPreorder(preorder[i:])

        return root
        # This solution has a time complexity of O(nÂ²) in the worst case because for each node, we might need to scan through O(n) elements to find the split between left and right subtrees, and there are n nodes. The space complexity is O(n) due to the recursion stack.
