        Main solution using stack to simulate collisions.

        Core logic:
        - Right-moving (+) asteroids go to stack (potential collision targets)
        - Left-moving (-) asteroids collide with stack top if top is positive
        - Same direction asteroids never collide

        Time: O(n) - each asteroid pushed/popped at most once
        Space: O(n) - stack storage

        * nouns and verbs:
        intergers in a row, indices... position, array, absolute value: size, sign: direction, same speed, state, explode: smaller one, both when same size , never meet: same direction

        * pattern kws
        in a row

        * structural kws
        no? asteroids[i] != 0
        absolute values (sizes)
        directions: positive = right, negative = left; no two same position start

        * algo concepts:
        collision: need to track interactions
        final state after all collisions: process until stable
        destroy based on size: comparison
        order matters: sequential processing
        in a row => stack

        * mental categories:
        stack: for tracking right-moving asteroids
        state machine: stable vs collision states

        * tricky kws:
        moving in sae direction: no collision
        equal size: both destroyed
        explosion rules: remove from result
